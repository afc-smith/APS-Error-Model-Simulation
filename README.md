# APS-Error-Model-Simulation

The files in this repository provide an illustrative example of how to run an error model simulation to derive outcome-based analytical performance specifications (APS). 

This code was developed to accompany the following manuscript: 
Smith AF, Messenger MP, Hulme CT, Turvill J, Hall PS and Shinkins B. Setting outcome-based analytical performance specifications using simulation: a case study of faecal calprotectin. TBC.
